Thirteen is a version of the Vietnamese card game, Tiến Lên.

The first iteration of the game will be a JavaFX application and eventually
will turn into a web application.

Please read the contributors file for information and help about setting up
project (it will not compile upon first import) since I am not too experienced
with setting up Maven build dependencies.
